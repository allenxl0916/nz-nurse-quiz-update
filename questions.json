Giving advice, changing topics, or offering false reassurance can impede communication."}, {"question": "Set 7: During auscultation, which breath sound indicates fluid in the alveoli?", "options": ["Pleural friction rub", "Stridor", "Wheezes", "Crackles"], "answer": 3, "explanation": "Crackles (rales) are caused by air moving through fluid in the alveoli, indicating conditions like pneumonia or heart failure. \nWheezes are high\u2011pitched sounds from narrowed airways (e.g., asthma). Stridor is a harsh inspiratory sound from upper airway obstruction.

Vitamin D synthesis occurs in the stratum basale. Temperature regulation involves blood vessels and sweat glands rather than the stratum corneum."}, {"question": "Set 12: The prescription is 5 mg/kg for a 50 kg patient. What is the total dose?", "options": ["125 mg", "187 mg", "375 mg", "250 mg"], "answer": 3, "explanation": "Dose required is 5 mg/kg for a 50 kg patient = 50\u00d75 = 250 mg.

The drainage bag should be below bladder level to prevent reflux. Disconnecting frequently increases contamination risk. Single\u2011use catheters must not be reused."}, {"question": "Set 12: What is the recommended depth for chest compressions during adult CPR?", "options": ["3 inches (7.5 cm)", "1 inch (2.5 cm)", "At least 2 inches (5 cm)", "Half an inch (1.25 cm)"], "answer": 2, "explanation": "Adult CPR guidelines recommend compressing the chest at least 2 inches (5 cm) to generate adequate blood flow.
