          "question": "During auscultation, which breath sound indicates fluid in the alveoli?",

            "Wheezes",
            "Stridor",
            "Pleural friction rub"
          ],
          "answer": 0,
          "explanation": "Crackles (rales) are caused by air moving through fluid in the alveoli, indicating conditions like pneumonia or heart failure. \nWheezes are high\u2011pitched sounds from narrowed airways (e.g., asthma). Stridor is a harsh inspiratory sound from upper airway obstruction. A pleural friction rub is a grating sound from inflamed pleural surfaces."

          ],
          "answer": 0,
          "explanation": "Naloxone is an opioid antagonist used to reverse opioid toxicity. Flumazenil reverses benzodiazepines, vitamin K reverses warfarin, and atropine treats bradycardia."

            "Ignore the refusal"
          ],
          "answer": 1,
          "explanation": "Patients have the right to refuse treatment. The nurse should document the refusal, assess reasons, provide education, and notify the prescriber. Forcing or disguising medication violates autonomy and ethics."

          "answer": 2,
          "explanation": "Bowman\u2019s capsule surrounds the glomerulus and collects filtrate that has been filtered through the glomerular capillaries. \nThe proximal tubule reabsorbs most filtrate components. The loop of Henle concentrates the filtrate, and the collecting duct adjusts final urine concentration."

          ],
          "answer": 0,
          "explanation": "Insulin, produced by pancreatic beta cells, facilitates uptake of glucose into cells, lowering blood glucose. \nGlucagon increases blood glucose by stimulating glycogenolysis. Cortisol and growth hormone have hyperglycaemic effects and oppose insulin."

          "answer": 1,
          "explanation": "The olfactory nerve (cranial nerve I) transmits sensory information related to smell. \nThe optic nerve (II) transmits visual information. The trigeminal nerve (V) carries sensory and motor information to the face, and the facial nerve (VII) controls facial muscles and taste sensation in the anterior tongue."
